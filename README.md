##  Description 
I have developed a timed coding quiz that incorporates multiple-choice questions. The application is designed to operate within a browser environment and incorporates dynamically updated HTML and CSS that are powered by my JavaScript code. Additionally, the user interface has been refined to ensure a clean, polished, and responsive experience.
